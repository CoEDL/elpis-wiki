# Letter to sound prep

## Diphthongs? Put these earlier in the l2s, above single characters
eg 
```
ng ŋ
n n
```

## Consecutive characters
Listen to the audio, is there one phoneme or two? if only one, add a line to `letter-to-sound.txt`, mapping the consecutive characters to a single symbol and rebuild the lexicon. 

For example, if `wu̱nne̱` is mapped to `wu̱nne̱ w ɨ n n ɛ` in the lexicon, then add `nn n` to `letter-to-sound.txt`, upload it again and rebuild the lexicon. 

The results should be collapsed lexicon entry `wu̱nne̱ w ɨ n ɛ`.
