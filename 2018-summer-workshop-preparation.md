# 2018 Summer School preparation

## Installing Docker

Docker is the environment in which we will run Kaldi, one of the speech recognition systems. To install Docker, see the guides below for your system. It should install easily, please get in touch if you have issues with the installation.

* OS X: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
* Linux (Ubuntu): https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/
* Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

> Note that the Windows version of Docker is designed for 64bit Windows 10 Pro. For older or non-pro (home) versions of Windows, try installing Docker Toolbox: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/



## Get the workshop code

Now you have Docker installed, let's get the code that we'll use in the workshop. We'll go through what these steps mean on the day, but it would be good to do this before you get to Canberra as it can take a while to download. The image we are downloading is about 1GB in size.

1) Start the Docker application you have just installed.


2) Once the Docker application is running, open up a *Terminal* or *Command Prompt* window.

  > What is a terminal or command prompt??

  > Programs like Word and Elan have a "graphical user interface (GUI)". This is a way of interacting with the program using menus, buttons, clicking on things with a mouse. Some programs don't have GUIs, you interact with them by typing instructions into the command line, or terminal.

  > When you start your terminal, it will display a `$` or `>` sign at the start of the command line. Hence, when you see something like `$ blah blah blah` in the workshop steps, you donâ€™t need to type the `$` sign, just type the words in the instruction that follow it.


3) In the terminal window, type the following just to check that docker is happy (it should give you a version number):

```
docker --version

```

3.1) Result. Something like...
```
Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a
```


4) Now download the workshop code by typing or copy-and-pasting this into your terminal:

```
docker pull coedl/kaldi-helpers:0.64
```

This might take a while, it should give you some information about progress.
